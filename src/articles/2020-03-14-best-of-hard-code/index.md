## “How can I be a better engineering manager?”

I’ve asked some variant of this question to myself ever since I assumed the role around a year ago in April 2019. As an IC (Individual Contributor), I had a very intuitive understanding of what my role was and what I needed to do. Once I transitioned to management, however, it was murkier. I couldn’t even accurately describe what my role was. What was I supposed to do now? Fortunately, Microsoft has an excellent manager training program that answers a lot of these questions, plus a two-day intensive “manager bootcamp” that I flew to headquarters for.

But when it comes to advice and expertise on being a great software engineering manager, you can’t get much better than Eric Brechner. His articles and information on software engineering and management are a goldmine, and I’ll help you get started with the best of the best. But who is he, and why should we believe what he says?

## Who is Eric Brechner?
Eric is the development manager for the Xbox Engineering Services team. Before his current assignment, Eric managed development for the Xbox.com web sites, was director of engineering learning and development for Microsoft Corporation, and managed development for a shared feature team in Microsoft Office. Eric has been working for Microsoft since 1995. (More info [here](https://imwrightshardcode.com/about-the-author/))

Pretty impressive, but what is more impressive is how consistently Eric has been in sharing his advice and learning with others. In 2001, he started an opinion column titled “[Hard Code](https://imwrightshardcode.com/)” under the pseudonym I.M. Wright with the tagline “Brutally honest, no pulled punches.” His writing is consistently read by thousands of Microsoft engineers and managers each month (to this day!). He is nearing 200 completed columns, with many of them made into a [book](https://imwrightshardcode.com/book/). 

He wrote many of the articles for an internal Microsoft audience, so some of the columns contain terminology that may not make sense to people who have never worked at the company. Still, the vast majority of his advice can be applied to anyone working as a software engineer or engineering manager. Because there are so many articles, it can be difficult to know where to start. But I have summarized the best ones here along with my commentary on what makes them great.

## The Best of “Hard Code”
[The good stuff](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2020/03/the-good-stuff/)
Published in March 2020, this post is hands down the best intro to Eric’s work. In this post, Eric talks about the best practices of modern high performing software engineering teams and why teams that follow these industry best practices are twice as likely to succeed as those that don’t. 

For each best practice he mentions (such as organizing small feature teams using DevOps and lean practices that result in continuous delivery), he provides several links to his previous articles that go more in-depth about those specific topics. If you want a single introduction to “Hard Code” - with plenty of links to explore more, you won’t find a better one than this.

[I can manage](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2005/12/i-can-manage/)
First published back in 2005, this article still stands the test of time as the best piece of advice to new managers. 
In it he argues that a good manager only needs to do two things: 

1) Make sure her employees can work and 
2) Care about her employees. 

Of course, a great manager can and will do more, but avoiding being a bad manager is as simple as those two tasks (which are not hard). Eric goes further in advice for new managers in a follow-up column called “[never been manager](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2016/09/never-been-manager/).” Other useful posts on being a good manager are [management malady](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2017/11/management-malady/) and [the toughest job poor performers](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2004/11/the-toughest-job-poor-performers/).

[The importance of having a vision](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2013/10/vision-quest/)
In this article, Eric talks about how having a compelling vision can drive progress in unimaginable ways while having an ambiguous or unambitious vision will encourage stagnation. When Microsoft fulfilled its original vision of “A computer on every desk and in every home,” it stumbled primarily due to having a lack of vision. A leader’s job is to define a compelling vision and get people excited to push towards that vision.

[The day we met](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2004/06/the-day-we-met/)
Excellent article on how most meetings are a colossal waste of time, which meetings are useful, and how to respect people’s time. Most people still run terrible meetings—they don’t share a focused agenda in advance, they invite too many people, they schedule too much time, and they don’t share an actionable recap with everyone impacted. Eric writes more about that in a follow-up article called [“Is never good for you?”](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2017/02/is-never-good-for-you/)

[You have to make a decision](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2011/04/you-have-to-make-a-decision/)
“What’s worse—a flawed decision or no decision? That’s easy. Decisions keep a business moving. An imperfect decision might move your business slightly in the wrong direction, but at least it will be moving. Make a few adjustments, and you’re back on track.”
A common problem I face as an engineering manager is having to make hard decisions without knowing everything I’d like to know. The advice in this article is to absorb all the relevant information that you can and then trust your intuition. This correlates well with a piece of career advice that I received from one of my previous managers, that the higher up you go in a company, the more you are paid for your decision-making abilities and not your technical skills. Leaders that can show consistent good decision-making ability will naturally ascend to positions with higher responsibility.

[Your World. Easier](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2009/04/your-world-easier/)
Simple advice on how to achieve better results in a system: single-piece flow and checklists. Single-piece flow is perhaps the most underrated concept in software engineering. By choosing to focus on fewer things at once and driving those items to completion before moving on, you end up shipping a lot more a lot faster than if you hadn’t.
