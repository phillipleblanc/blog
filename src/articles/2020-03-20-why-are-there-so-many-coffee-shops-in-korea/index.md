If you’ve never been to Korea before, something that may surprise you is the sheer number of coffee shops everywhere you look. At first I thought that Korean people really like coffee (I mean, who doesn’t right?), and while that is true that isn’t the whole story.

**Most Koreans live with their parents until marriage.** Why? A tempting argument to make would be that this is simply a cultural tradition that has kept its strength from a group of people that have traditional, conservative family values. While these cultural factors are important, in practice they are often overstated. The biggest hurdle to living alone in Korea is money. Unlike the US, which often requires just a month of rent as deposit, the amount of money needed for a deposit on a Korean apartment is much larger. The first apartment I rented in Seoul required a deposit of around $10,000 - which was the lowest deposit I could find at the time. Most young Koreans working part-time jobs with low wages won’t be able to come up with the kind of money they need to live by themselves. (The reasons for why this system exists are too complex to get into here, look out for another article in the future on this topic.)

**House parties don’t exist in Korea.** I’ve never once been asked to go to a party at the house of a Korean. Or even just to hang out. From what I’ve gathered, there are two major factors that contribute to this. The first is a cultural reason - most Koreans consider their home to be a very private place that only their families have access to. The second is a more practical reason. The average size of a single person apartment is around 300 square feet. That is just way too small of a space to live and also entertain guests.

**Enter coffee shops.** Beyond places to get your favorite latte, coffee shops are essentially de-facto hangout spots. Walk into any coffee shop in Korea and you will see couples with their arms wrapped around each other, groups of friends talking about the latest gossip, people buried in their studies, etc. A coffee shop’s biggest draw is the space that it offers people to chill and gossip, and sometimes work. And in Seoul, there are a lot of people living in very densely populated residential areas. Those people all need places to hang out, and thus a lot of coffee shops have sprung up to fill the void.

In central Seoul there are three different Starbucks that are less than a two-minute walk from the building I work in. Not to mention the two other coffee shops inside of the building, as well as two in the next building. The sheer number of coffee shops around means there is intense competition for customers. The best coffee shops usually compete on providing the best atmosphere with creative decorations, having a bakery, or whatever else they think will draw people in.

Take for example this cafe near the popular Hongdae district of Seoul that bring customers in by drawing them into another dimension through a 2D optical illusion.

Or how about this coffee shop that is shaped like a Rolleiflex Camera.

Or if magic is more your style, then you might want to grab a butterbeer at this Harry Potter-themed cafe - also located in the Hongdae area.

So there you have it! If you ever find yourself passing through Korea, make sure to stop into a cafe and grab a latte. There should be plenty of options to choose from.
