Whenever I tell people that I am living in Seoul, South Korea, the very next question they have is, “but why?” I usually tell people a straightforward answer like, “I was fascinated by the culture/language” or “I had an opportunity, and I figured I would take it.” 

The real answer is, of course, a lot more complicated and nuanced, but I don’t always have the required 20 minutes it would take to answer that question.

The truth is - there wasn’t a single motivation for it, it was the perfect storm of opportunity + experiences in my life that made me pull the trigger. But to truly understand this, I need to start with some background.

I was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and went to my local university - Louisiana State University. I did not have the typical college life that is often stereotyped. I stayed at home and commuted to my classes every day. When I wasn’t in class, I went to my part-time research job at the LSU Center for Computation and Technology. I only had a couple of friends that I would hang out with outside of class, and I spent a lot of my free time playing video games or writing software. One of the video games I played a lot was Starcraft 2 - which was hugely popular in Korea at that time. I even joined a local campus club dedicated to people playing Starcraft 2.

If you aren’t familiar with the Starcraft franchise, it is a strategy game where two people compete against each other to mine resources to build an army and defeat the other player. In Korea, especially, the game amassed enormous popularity with lots of players and viewers. So much so that TV broadcasters would televise big Starcraft matches on national TV. In all of the significant Starcraft tournaments around the world, the Korean players would consistently destroy all other competition. The birth of the worldwide esports phenomena owes its existence to Korea and Starcraft, and I was immersed in this subculture early on.

In May 2012, I graduated from LSU with a degree in Computer Science and a job offer for Microsoft as a software engineer. One of the first things I did when I started at Microsoft was to join the Starcraft 2 club there. I made a lot of great friends from that club early on, but I lost interest in Starcraft after the first year or so.

When I first moved to work for Microsoft, I lived near the campus headquarters in Redmond, WA. I was close enough to be able to bike to work, but the downside was the area I was living in had nothing going on during the weekend. After a year, I moved to Seattle and got a roommate who was one of my classmates from LSU that also started at Microsoft. As luck would have it, the next-door neighbor in our Seattle apartment ended up becoming my best friend. He was an Australian guy also working for Microsoft. Over the next four years, we became close and went on lots of crazy adventures with our group of friends. But it wasn’t to last, after a few years he wanted to move back to Australia to be with his long-distance girlfriend. 

We decided to go on a 3-month long trip around the world, as one last hurrah before he moved away. He had been to many European countries, but neither of us had been to any parts of Asia. So after some back and forth on which countries to visit, we had an itinerary! One of the places we were going to visit was, of course, Seoul, Korea. 

Before we embarked, I found myself at a party with friends from the Microsoft Starcraft 2 club. While there, I mentioned my plans to visit Korea. Two guys wanted to tag along for the Korean week of our trip, so we invited them along!

In February of 2016, we embarked on the trip that would change the course of my life. Looking back on this trip, I think the most fun we had was in Korea. All four of us were Starcraft 2 nerds, and we went to watch a couple of live Starcraft 2 competitions! We also did a lot of other exciting activities in Korea, and I fantasized a bit about how neat it would be to live here. I knew Microsoft had an office in Korea, but I wasn’t sure if they had any software engineering positions. I also became fascinated with the Korean alphabet system. One of the tourist attractions in Seoul teaches you the basics of the alphabet, and I was entranced by it. A long time ago, most Koreans couldn’t read or write because the standard alphabet used to be based on the Chinese system. One of the kings wanted to create an alphabet that commoners could quickly learn, and he single-handedly created the alphabet that is still in use today. The Korean alphabet, Hangul, is one of the simplest alphabets in the world, and you can learn it in an afternoon.

After the trip, I started learning the Korean language (which, unlike the alphabet, is not so easy to learn) and joined a local Seattle Meetup group for people interested in Korea. I found a Korean willing to tutor me, and I started watching more Korean dramas and listening to Korean pop music. At this time, I was looking more aggressively into opportunities that would allow me to move to Korea, but nothing came up. My friend, who worked for Google, suggested that I apply to the Korea office since they were hiring. That ended up not working out, but after that, I became more convinced I wanted to work in Korea. I put a search alert on the internal Microsoft careers site to email me about any positions that opened up for software engineering in Korea. I honestly didn’t expect anything to come up from that, but it was at least worth trying. A couple of months later, the manager of a software engineering team in Microsoft Korea messaged me. I was already planning a vacation to Korea for a couple of weeks after his first message, so we met while I was visiting. He offered me the job on the spot, and a couple of months later, I was living in Seoul!

Of course, moving and adjusting to life here wasn’t quite that simple, and my family wasn’t entirely on-board with it at first, but that is a story for another time. If you’re interested in hearing more about my adventures in Korea, let me know by subscribing to my newsletter!
